# OOP-SVG-logo-maker

## Description
This project is about building a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file.

## Motivation for the Project
I was curious to know how I can design my own logo without hiring a graphic designer. I plan to use the knowledge gained from this application to design my own logo for future projects. 

## What Problem does it solve? 
It saves the cost of hiring a graphic designer to design a logo for a developer. As a freelance developer, I do not have to pay a graphic designer to design a simple logo for my projects.

## Usage 
The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a svg file. 

## License 
MIT license was used for creating this repository.
